different gods and heroes, whilst also learning about herself, and her powers and historical influences.

## Author

My name is **KJ Sylva**, I am an illustrator and amateur comic book writer and
artist.

I was a teenager when I realized my passion for art. I went to a local community college for Commercial Art and Illustration, graduating in December of 2013. My last semester I took a comics and sequential art class and found that creating comics was an even deeper passion of mine. But getting to the point where I was ready to actually explore creating comics took me longer than I anticipated. However, I am more than ready now.

I have always considered myself a story teller, whether I am just trying to tell a local story to a friend, or day dreaming fantasy stories in my head. I have never been a formal writer, so creating my stories through art became the best way for my to express my concepts and ideas! I absolutely plan to make a career out of being a comic book artist!

I fell in love with concept art and fanart browsing on Deviantart, and looking at outstanding original pieces of digital art work created and being awed and inspired by the fantastic detail and passion put into some digital art. As much as I love recreating characters that exist in my favorite comics, or video games, it is also my goal to be able to create many original characters
and to recreate or manipulate landscapes. I know that from here on out, I will constantly be learning. I don't think anyone is ever done learning how to create art. It is a life long journey and I am ready to follow through with that.
