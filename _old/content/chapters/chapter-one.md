  After waking up from a weird dream that spoke about prophecy, war, and
  destruction, Brie immediately seeks out what the dream meant from her
  psychologist, Dr. Astrid. However, Dr. Astrid tells her that the dream was
  only a consequence of her excessive alcoholism and that the only answer is to
  stop drinking. Not satisfied with what she was told, and obsessing over the
  meaning, Brie decides she will find the answer on her own.
